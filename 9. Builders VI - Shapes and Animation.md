# Builders Part VI - Shapes and Animation


JavaFX comes with nodes that represent almost any geometric shape as well as a `Path` node that
provides facilities required for assembly and management of a geometric path \(to create custom shapes\). JavaFX also has animation support to gradually change a `Node` property, creating a visual transition between two states. TornadoFX seeks to streamline all these features through builder constructs.

## Shape Basics

Every parameter to the shape builders are optional, and in most cases default to a value of `0.0`.
This means that you only need to provide the parameters you care about. The builders have positional parameters
for most of the properties of each shape, and the rest can be set in the functional block that follows. Therefore these are all valid ways to create a rectangle:

```kotlin
rectangle {
    width = 100.0
    height = 100.0
}

rectangle(width = 100.0, height = 100.0)

rectangle(0.0, 0.0, 100.0, 100.0)
```

The form you choose is a matter of preference, but obviously consider the legibility of the code you write. The examples in this
chapter specify most of the properties inside the code block for clarity, except when there is no code block support
or the parameters are reasonably self-explanatory.

### Positioning within the Parent

Most of the shape builders give you the option to specify the location of the shape within the parent.
Whether or not this will have any effect depends on the parent node. An `HBox` will not care about the `x` and `y`
coordinates you specify unless you call `setManaged(false)` on the shape. However, a `Group` control will. The screenshots in the following examples will be created by wrapping a `StackPane` with padding around a `Group`, and finally the shape was created inside that `Group` as shown below.

```kotlin
class MyView: View() {

    override val root =  stackpane {
       group {
            //shapes will go here
       }
    }
}
```

## Rectangle

`Rectangle` defines a rectangle with an optional size and location in the parent. Rounded corners can be specified with the `arcWidth` and `arcHeight` properties (Figure 9.1).

```kotlin
rectangle {
    fill = Color.BLUE
    width = 300.0
    height = 150.0
    arcWidth = 20.0
    arcHeight = 20.0
}
```

## Arc

`Arc` represents an arc object defined by a center, start angle, angular extent \(length of the arc in degrees\), and an arc type
\(`OPEN`, `CHORD`, or `ROUND`\) (Figure 9.2)

```kotlin
arc {
    centerX = 200.0
    centerY = 200.0
    radiusX = 50.0
    radiusY = 50.0
    startAngle = 45.0
    length = 250.0
    type = ArcType.ROUND
}
```

## Circle

`Circle` represents a circle with the specified `radius` and `center`.

```kotlin
circle {
    centerX = 100.0
    centerY = 100.0
    radius = 50.0
}
```

## CubicCurve

`CubicCurve` represents a cubic Bézier parametric curve segment in \(x,y\) coordinate space. Drawing a curve that intersects both the specified coordinates \(`startX`, `startY`\) and \(`endX`, `enfY`\), using the specified points \(`controlX1`, `controlY1`\) and \(`controlX2`, `controlY2`\) as Bézier control points.

```kotlin
cubiccurve {
    startX = 0.0
    startY = 50.0
    controlX1 = 25.0
    controlY1 = 0.0
    controlX2 = 75.0
    controlY2 = 100.0
    endX = 150.0
    endY = 50.0
    fill = Color.GREEN
}
```

## Ellipse

`Ellipse` represents an ellipse with parameters specifying size and location.

```kotlin
ellipse {
    centerX = 50.0
    centerY = 50.0
    radiusX = 100.0
    radiusY = 50.0
    fill = Color.CORAL
}
```

## Line

Line is fairly straight forward. Supply start and end coordinates to draw a line between the two points.

```kotlin
line {
    startX = 50.0
    startY = 50.0
    endX = 150.0
    endY = 100.0
}
```

## Polyline

A `Polyline` is defined by an array of segment points. `Polyline`is similar to `Polygon`, except it is not automatically closed.

```kotlin
polyline(0.0, 0.0, 80.0, 40.0, 40.0, 80.0)
```

## QuadCurve

The `Quadcurve`represents a quadratic Bézier parametric curve segment in \(x,y\) coordinate space. Drawing a curve that intersects both the specified coordinates \(`startX`, `startY`\) and \(`endX`, `endY`\), using the specified point \(`controlX`, `controlY`\) as Bézier control point.

```kotlin
quadcurve {
    startX = 0.0
    startY = 150.0
    endX = 150.0
    endY = 150.0
    controlX = 75.0
    controlY = 0.0
    fill = Color.BURLYWOOD
}
```

## SVGPath

`SVGPath`represents a shape that is constructed by parsing SVG path data from a String.

```kotlin
svgpath("M70,50 L90,50 L120,90 L150,50 L170,50 L210,90 L180,120 L170,110 L170,200 L70,200 L70,110 L60,120 L30,90 L70,50") {
    stroke = Color.DARKGREY
    strokeWidth = 2.0
    effect = DropShadow()
}
```

## Path

`Path` represents a shape and provides facilities required for basic construction and management of a geometric path. In other words, it helps you create a custom shape. The following helper functions can be used to constuct the path:

* `moveTo(x, y)`
* `hlineTo(x)`
* `vlineTo(y)`
* `quadqurveTo(controlX, controlY, x, y)`
* `lineTo(x, y)`
* `arcTo(radiusX, radiusY, xAxisRotation, x, y, largeArcFlag, sweepFlag)`
* `closepath()`

```kotlin
path {
    moveTo(0.0, 0.0)
    hlineTo(70.0)
    quadqurveTo {
        x = 120.0
        y = 60.0
        controlX = 100.0
        controlY = 0.0
    }
    lineTo(175.0, 55.0)
    arcTo {
        x = 50.0
        y = 50.0
        radiusX = 50.0
        radiusY = 50.0
    }
}
```

# Animation

JavaFX has tools to animate any `Node` by gradually changing one or more of its properties. There are three components you work with to create animations in JavaFX.

* `Timeline` - A sequence of `KeyFrame` items executed in a specified order

* `KeyFrame` - A "snapshot" specifying value changes on one or more writable properties \(via a  `KeyValue`\) on one or more Nodes

* `KeyValue` - A pairing of a `Node` property to a value that will be "transitioned" to


A `KeyValue` is the basic building block of JavaFX animation. It specifies a property and the "new value" it will gradually be transitioned to. So if you have a `Rectangle` with a `rotateProperty()` of `0.0`, and you specify a `KeyValue` that changes it to `90.0` degrees, it will incrementally move from `0.0` to `90.0` degrees. Put that `KeyValue` inside a `KeyFrame` which will specify how long the animation between those two values will last. In this case let's make it 5 seconds. Then finally put that `KeyFrame` in a `Timeline`. If you run the code below, you will see a rectange gradually rotate from \`0.0\` to \`90.0\` degrees in 5 seconds \(Figure 9.1\).

```
val rectangle = rectangle(width = 60.0,height = 40.0) {
    padding = Insets(20.0)
}
timeline {
    keyframe(Duration.seconds(5.0)) {
        keyvalue(rectangle.rotateProperty(),90.0)
    }
}
```

**Figure 9.1**

![](http://i.imgur.com/eHyKY6i.png)

In a given `KeyFrame`, you can simultaneously manipulate other properties in that 5-second window too. For instance we can transition the `arcWidthProperty()` and `arcHeightProperty()` while the `Rectangle` is rotating \(Figure 9.2\)

```
timeline {
        keyframe(Duration.seconds(5.0)) {
            keyvalue(rectangle.rotateProperty(),90.0)
            keyvalue(rectangle.arcWidthProperty(),60.0)
            keyvalue(rectangle.arcHeightProperty(),60.0)
        }
}
```

**Figure 9.2**

#### Interpolators

You can also specify an `Interpolator` which can add subtle effects to the animation. For instance, you can specify `Interpolator.EASE_BOTH` to accelerate and decelerate the value change at the beginning and end of the animation gracefully.


```
val rectangle = rectangle(width = 60.0, height = 40.0) {
    padding = Insets(20.0)
}

timeline {
    keyframe(5.seconds) {
        keyvalue(rectangle.rotateProperty(), 180.0, interpolator = Interpolator.EASE_BOTH)
    }
}
```

#### Cycles and AutoReverse


You can modify other attributes of the `timeline()` such as `cycleCount` and `autoReverse`. The `cycleCount` will repeat the animation a specified number of times, and setting the `isAutoReverse` to true will cause it to revert back with each cycle.

```kotlin
timeline {
    keyframe(5.seconds) {
        keyvalue(rectangle.rotateProperty(), 180.0, interpolator = Interpolator.EASE_BOTH)
    }
    isAutoReverse = true
    cycleCount = 3
}
```


To repeat the animation indefinitely, set the `cycleCount` to `Timeline.INDEFINITE`.

#### Shorthand Animation

If you want to animate a single property, you can quickly animate it without declaring a `timeline()`, `keyframe()`, and `keyset()`. Call the `animate()` extension function on that propert and provide the `endValue`, the `duration`, and optionally the `interoplator`. This is much shorter and cleaner if you are animating just one property.

```kotlin
rectangle.rotateProperty().animate(endValue = 180.0, duration = 5.seconds)
```

## Summary

In this chapter we covered builders for shape and animation. We did not cover JavaFX's `Canvas` as this is beyond the scope of the `TornadoFX` framework. It could easily take up more than several chapters on its own. But the shapes and animation should allow you to do basic custom graphics for a majority of tasks.

This concludes our coverage of TornadoFX builders for now. Next we will cover FXML for those of us that have need to use it.
