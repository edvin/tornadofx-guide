# Editing Models and Validation

TornadoFX doesn't force any particular architectural pattern on you as a developer, and it works equally well with both [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller), [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–presenter), and their derivatives.

To help with implementing these patterns TornadoFX provides a tool called `ViewModel` that helps cleanly separate your UI and business logic, giving you features like _rollback_/_commit_ and _dirty state checking_. These patterns are hard or cumbersome to implement manually, so it is advised to leverage the `ViewModel` and `ViewModelItem` when it is needed.

Typically you will use the `ViewModelItem` for most cases over the `ViewModel`, but

## A Typical Use Case

Say you have a given domain type `Person`. We allow its two properties to be nullable so they can be inputted later by the user.

```kotlin
class Person(name: String? = null, title: String? = null) {
    var name by property(name)
    fun nameProperty() = getProperty(Person::name)

    var title by property(title)
    fun titleProperty() = getProperty(Person::title)
}
```

Consider a Master/Detail view where you have a `TableView` displaying a list of people, and a `Form` where the currently selected person's information can be edited. Before we get into the `ViewModel`, we will create a version of this `View` without using the `ViewModel`.

Below is code for our first attempt in building this, and it has a number of problems we will address.

```kotlin
import javafx.scene.control.TableView
import javafx.scene.control.TextField
import javafx.scene.layout.BorderPane
import tornadofx.*

class Person(name: String? = null, title: String? = null) {
    var name by property(name)
    fun nameProperty() = getProperty(Person::name)

    var title by property(title)
    fun titleProperty() = getProperty(Person::title)
}

class PersonEditor : View("Person Editor") {
    override val root = BorderPane()
    var nameField : TextField by singleAssign()
    var titleField : TextField by singleAssign()
    var personTable : TableView<Person> by singleAssign()
    // Some fake data for our table
    val persons = listOf(Person("John", "Manager"), Person("Jay", "Worker bee")).observable()

    var prevSelection: Person? = null

    init {
        with(root) {
            // TableView showing a list of people
            center {
                tableview(persons) {
                    personTable = this
                    column("Name", Person::nameProperty)
                    column("Title", Person::titleProperty)

                    // Edit the currently selected person
                    selectionModel.selectedItemProperty().onChange {
                        editPerson(it)
                        prevSelection = it
                    }
                }
            }

            right {
                form {
                    fieldset("Edit person") {
                        field("Name") {
                            textfield() {
                                nameField = this
                            }
                        }
                        field("Title") {
                            textfield() {
                                titleField = this
                            }
                        }
                        button("Save") {
                            setOnAction {
                                save()
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private fun editPerson(person: Person?) {
        if (person != null) {
            prevSelection?.apply {
                nameProperty().unbindBidirectional(nameField.textProperty())
                titleProperty().unbindBidirectional(titleField.textProperty())
            }
            nameField.bind(person.nameProperty())
            titleField.bind(person.titleProperty())
            prevSelection = person
        }
    }

    private fun save() {
        // Extract the selected person from the tableView
        val person = personTable.selectedItem!!

        // A real application would persist the person here
        println("Saving ${person.name} / ${person.title}")
    }
}
```

We define a `View` consisting of a `TableView` in the center of a `BorderPane` and a `Form` on the right side. We define some properties for the form fields and the table itself so we can reference them later.

While we build the table, we attach a listener to the selected item so we can call the `editPerson` function when the table selection changes. The `editPerson` function binds the properties of the selected person to the text fields in the form.

## Problems with our initial attempt

At first glance it might look OK, but when we dig deeper there are several issues.

### Manual binding

Every time the selection in the table changes, we have to unbind/rebind the data for the form fields manually. Apart from the added code and logic, there is another huge problem with this: the data is updated for every change in the text fields, and the changes will even be reflected in the table. While this might look cool and is technically correct, it presents one big problem: what if the user does not want to save the changes? We have no way of rolling back. So to prevent this, we would have to skip the binding altogether and manually extract the values from the text fields, then create a new `Person` object on save. In fact, this is a pattern found in many applications and expected by most users. Implementing a "Reset" button for this form would mean managing variables with the initial values and again assigning those values manually to the text fields.

### Tight Coupling

Another issue is when it is time to save the edited person, the save function has to extract the selected item from the table again. For that to happen the save function has to know about the `TableView`. Alternatively it would have to know about the text fields like the `editPerson` function does, and manually extract the values to reconstruct a `Person` object.

## Introducing ViewModel

The `ViewModel` is a mediator between the `TableView` and the `Form`. It acts as a middleman between the data in the text fields and the data in the actual `Person` object. As you will see, the code is much shorter and easier to reason about. The implementation code of the `PersonModel` will be shown shortly. For now just focus on its usage.

```kotlin
class PersonEditor : View("Person Editor") {
    override val root = BorderPane()
    val persons = listOf(Person("John", "Manager"), Person("Jay", "Worker bee")).observable()
    val model = PersonModel(Person())

    init {
        with(root) {
            center {
                tableview(persons) {
                    column("Name", Person::nameProperty)
                    column("Title", Person::titleProperty)

                    // Update the person inside the view model on selection change
                    model.rebindOnChange(this) { selectedPerson ->
                        person = selectedPerson ?: Person()
                    }
                }
            }

            right {
                form {
                    fieldset("Edit person") {
                        field("Name") {
                            textfield(model.name)
                        }
                        field("Title") {
                            textfield(model.title)
                        }
                       button("Save") {
                            disableProperty().bind(model.dirtyStateProperty().not())
                            setOnAction {
                                save()
                            }
                        }
                        button("Reset") {
                            setOnAction {
                                model.rollback()
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private fun save() {
        // Flush changes from the text fields into the model
        model.commit()

        // The edited person is contained in the model
        val person = model.person

        // A real application would persist the person here
        println("Saving ${person.name} / ${person.title}")
    }

}
class PersonModel(var person: Person) : ViewModel() {
    val name = bind { person.nameProperty() }
    val title = bind { person.titleProperty() }
}
```

This looks a lot better, but what exactly is going on here? We have introduced a subclass of `ViewModel` called `PersonModel`. The model holds a `Person` object and has properties for the `name` and `title` fields. We will discuss the model further after we have looked at the rest of the client code.

Note that we hold no reference to the `TableView` or the text fields. Apart from a lot less code, the first big change is the way we update the `Person` inside the model:

```kotlin
model.rebindOnChange(this) { selectedPerson ->
    person = selectedPerson ?: Person()
}
```

The `rebindOnChange()` function takes the `TableView` as an argument and a function that will be called when the selection changes. This works with `ListView`,`TreeView`, `TreeTableView`, and any other `ObservableValue` as well. This function is called on the model and has the `selectedPerson` as its single argument. We assign the selected person to the `person` property of the model, or a new  `Person` if the selection was empty/null. That way we ensure that there is always data for the model to present.

When we create the TextFields, we bind the model properties directly to it since most `Node` builders accept an `ObservableValue` to bind to.

```kotlin
field("Name") {
    textfield(model.name)
}
```

Even when the selection changes, the model properties persist but the values for the properties are updated. We totally avoid the manual binding from our previous attempt.

Another big change in this version is that the data in the table does not update when we type into the text fields. This is because the model has exposed a copy of the properties from the person object and does not write back into the actual person object before we call `model.commit()`. This is exactly what we do in the `save` function. Once `commit` has been called, the data in the facade is flushed back into our person object and the table will now reflect our changes.

## Rollback

Since the model holds a reference to the actual `Person` object, we can can reset the text fields to reflect the actual data in our `Person` object. We could add a reset button like this:

```kotlin
button("Reset") {
    setOnAction {
        model.rollback()
    }
}
```

When the button is pressed, any changes are discarded and the text fields show the actual `Person` object values again.

## The PersonModel

We never explained how the `PersonModel` works yet, and you probably have been wondering about how the `PersonModel` is implemented. Here it is:

```kotlin
class PersonModel(var person: Person) : ViewModel() {
    val name = bind { person.nameProperty() }
    val title = bind { person.titleProperty() }
}
```

It can hold a `Person` object, and it has defined two strange-looking properties called `name` and `title` via the `bind` delegate. Yeah it looks weird, but there is a very good reason for it. The `{ person.nameProperty() }` parameter for the `bind` function is a lambda that returns a property. This returned property is examined by the `ViewModel`, and a new property of the same type is created. It is the put into the `name` property of the `ViewModel`.

When we bind a text field to the `name` property of the model, only the copy is updated when you type into the text field. The `ViewModel` keeps track of which actual property belongs to which facade, and when you call `commit` the values from the facade are flushed into the actual backing property. On the flip side, when you call `rollback` the exact opposite happens: The actual property value is flushed into the facade.

The reason the actual property is wrapped in a function is that this makes it possible to change the `person` variable and then extract the property from that new person. You can read more about this below \(rebinding\).

## Dirty Checking

The model has a `Property` called `dirtyStateProperty`. This is a `Boolean`  property you can observe to enable or disable certain features. For example, we could easily disable the save button until there are actual changes. The updated save button would look like this:

```kotlin
button("Save") {
    disableProperty().bind(model.dirtyStateProperty().not())
    setOnAction {
        save()
    }
}
```

We connect the `disableProperty` of the button with an observable `Boolean` property that is true when the model is not dirty \(notice the `.not()` call to create a negated binding\).There is also a plain `val` called `isDirty` which returns a `Boolean` representing the dirty state for the entire model.

## Dirty Properties

You can check if a specific property is dirty, meaning that it has been changed compared to the backing source object value.

```kotlin
val nameWasChanged = model.isDirty(model.name)
```

There is also an extension property version that accomplishes the same task:

```kotlin
val nameWasChange = model.name.isDirty
```

The shorthand version is an extension `val` on `Property<T>` but it will only work for properties that are bound inside a `ViewModel`. You will find `model.isNotDirty` properties as well.

If you need to dynamically react based on the dirty state of a specific property in the `ViewModel`, you can get a hold of a `BooleanBinding` representing the dirty state of that field like this:

```kotlin
val nameDirtyProperty = model.dirtyStateFor(PersonModel::name)
```

## Extracting the Source Object Value

To retreive the backing object value for a property you can call `model.backingValue(property)`.

```kotlin
val person = model.backingValue(property)
```

## Supporting Objects that Do Not Expose JavaFX Properties

You probably wondered how to deal with domain objects that do not use JavaFX properties. Maybe you have a simple POJO with getters and setters, or normal kotlin `var` type properties. Since `ViewModel` requires JavaFX properties, TornadoFX comes with powerful wrappers that can turn any type of property into an observable JavaFX property. Here are some examples:

```kotlin
// Java POJO getter/setter property
class JavaPersonViewModel(person: JavaPerson) : ViewModel() {
    val name = bind { person.observable(JavaPerson::getName, JavaPerson::setName) }
}

// Kotlin var property
class PersonVarViewModel(person: Person) : ViewModel() {
    val name = bind { person.observable(Person::name) }
}
```

As you can see, it is easy to convert any property type to an observable property. When Kotlin 1.1. is releaed, the above syntax will be further simplified for non-JavaFX based properties.

## Specific Property Subtypes \(IntegerProperty, BooleanProperty\)

If you bind, for example, an `IntegerProperty`, the type of the facade property will look like `Property<Int>` but it is infact an `IntegerProperty` under the hood. If you need to access the special functions provided by `IntegerProperty`, you will have to cast the bind result:

```kotlin
val age = bind { person.ageProperty() } as IntegerProperty
```

Similarily, you can expose a read only property by specifying a read only type:

```kotlin
val age = bind { person.ageProperty() } as ReadOnlyIntegerProperty
```

The reason for this is an unfortunate shortcoming on the type system that prevents the compiler from differentiating between overloaded `bind` functions for these specific types, so the single `bind` function inside `ViewModel` inspects the property type and returns the best match, but unfortunately the return type signature has to be `Property<T>` for now.

## Rebinding

As you saw in the `TableView` example above, it is possible to change the domain object that is wrapped by the `ViewModel`. This test case sheds some more light on that:

```kotlin
@Test fun swap_source_object() {
    val person1 = Person("Person 1")
    val person2 = Person("Person 2")

    val model = PersonModel(person1)
    assertEquals(model.name, "Person 1")

    model.rebind { person = person2 }
    assertEquals(model.name, "Person 2")
}
```

The test creates two `Person` objects and a `ViewModel`. The model is initialised with the first person object. It then checks that `model.name` corresponds to the name in `person1`. Now something weird happens:

```kotlin
model.rebind { person = person2 }
```

The code inside the `rebind()` block above will be executed and all the properties of the model are updated with values from the new source object. This is actually analogous to writing:

```kotlin
model.person = person2
model.rollback()
```

The form you choose is up to you, but the first form makes sure you do not forget to call rebind. After `rebind` is called, the model is not dirty and all values will reflect the ones form the new source object or source objects. It's important to note that you can pass multiple source objects to a view model and update all or some of them as you see fit.

### Rebind Listener

Our `TableView` example called the `rebindOnChange()` function and passed in a `TableView` as the first argument. This made sure that rebind was called whenever the selection of the `TableView` changed. This is actually just a shortcut to another function with the same name that takes an observable and calls rebind whenever that observable changes. If you call this function, you do not need to call rebind manually as long as you have an observable that represent the state change that should cause the model to rebind.

As you saw, `TableView` has a shorthand support for the `selectionModel.selectedItemProperty`. If not for this shorthand function call, you would have to write it like this:

```kotlin
model.rebindOnChange(table.selectionModel.selectedItemProperty()) {
    person = it ?: Person()
}
```

The above example is included to clarify how the `rebindOnChange()` function works under the hood. For real use cases involving a `TableView`, you should opt for the shorter version or use the `ItemViewModel`.

## ItemViewModel

When working with the `ViewModel` you will notice some repetitive and somewhat verbose tasks. They include calling `rebind` or configuring `rebindOnChange` to change  
the source object. The `ItemViewModel` is an extension to the `ViewModel` and in almost all use cases you would want to inherit from this instead of the `ViewModel` class.

The `ItemViewModel` has a property called `itemProperty` of the specified type, so our `PersonModel` would now look like:

```kotlin
class PersonModel : ItemViewModel<Person>() {
    val name = bind { item?.nameProperty() }
    val title = bind { item?.titleProperty() }
}
```

You will notice we no longer need to pass in the `var person: Person` in the constructor. The `ItemViewModel` now has an observable property called  
`itemProperty` and getters/setters via the `item` property. Whenever you assign something to `item` or via `itemProperty.value`, the model is  
automatically rebound for you. There is also an observable `empty` boolean value you can use to check if the `ItemViewModel` is currently holding a `Person`.

The binding expressions need to take into account that it might not represent any item at the time of binding. That is why the binding  
expressions above now use the null safe operator.

We just got rid of some boiler plate, but the `ItemViewModel` gives us a lot more functionality. Remember how we bound the selected person from the `TableView` to our model earlier?

```kotlin
// Update the person inside the view model on selection change
model.rebindOnChange(this) { selectedPerson ->
    person = selectedPerson ?: Person()
}
```

Using the `ItemViewModel` this can be rewritten:

```kotlin
// Update the person inside the view model on selection change
bindSelected(model)
```

This will effectively attach the listener we had to write manually before and make sure that the `TableView` selection is visible in the model.

The `save()` function will now also be slightly different, since there is no `person` property in our model:

```kotlin
private fun save() {
    model.commit()
    val person = model.item
    println("Saving ${person.name} / ${person.title}")
}
```

The person is extracted from the `itemProperty` using the `item` getter.

When working with the ItemViewModel() and POJO's starting at 1.7.1 you can create the bindings as follows

```kotlin
data class Person(val firstName: String, val lastName: String)

class PersonModel : ItemViewModel<Person>() {
    val firstname = bind { item?.firstName?.toProperty() }
    val lastName = bind { item?.lastName?.toProperty() }
}
```
## Injectable Models

Most commonly you will not have both the `TableView` and the editor in the same `View`. We would then need to access the `ViewModel` from at least two different views, one for the `TableView` and one for the form. Luckily, the `ViewModel` is injectable, so we can rewrite our editor example and split the two views:

```kotlin
class PersonList : View("Person List") {
    val persons = listOf(Person("John", "Manager"), Person("Jay", "Worker bee")).observable()
    val model : PersonModel by inject()

    override val root = tableview(persons) {
        title = "Person
        column("Name", Person::nameProperty)
        column("Title", Person::titleProperty)
        bindSelected(model)
    }
}
```

The person `TableView` now becomes a lot cleaner and easier to reason with. In a real application the list of persons would probably come from a controller or a remoting call though. The model is simply injected into the `View`, and we will do the same for the editor:

```kotlin
class PersonEditor : View("Person Editor") {
    val model : PersonModel by inject()

    override val root = form {
        fieldset("Edit person") {
            field("Name") {
                textfield(model.name)
            }
            field("Title") {
                textfield(model.title)
            }
           button("Save") {
                disableProperty().bind(model.dirtyStateProperty().not())
                setOnAction {
                    save()
                }
            }
            button("Reset") {
                setOnAction {
                    model.rollback()
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private fun save() {
        model.commit()
        println("Saving ${model.item.name} / ${model.item.title}")
    }
}
```

The injected instance of the model will be the exact same one in both views. Again, in a real application the save call would probably be offloaded  
to a controller asynchronously.

## When to Use `ViewModel` vs `ItemViewModel`

This chapter has progressed from the low-level implementation `ViewModel` into a streamlined `ItemViewModel`. You might wonder if there are any use cases for inheriting from  
`ViewModel` instead of `ItemViewModel` at all. The answer is that while you would typically extend `ItemViewModel` more than 90% of the time, there are some use cases where it does not make sense. Since ViewModels can be injected and used to keep navigational state and overall UI state, you might use it for situations where you do not have a single domain object - you could have multiple domain objects or just a collection of loose properties. In this use case the `ItemViewModel` does not make any sense, and you might implement the `ViewModel` directly. For common cases though, `ItemViewModel` is your best friend.

> There is one potential issue with this approach. If we want to display multiple "pairs" of lists and forms, perhaps in different windows, we need a way to separate and bind the model belonging to a spesific pair of list and form. There are many ways to deal with that, but one tool very well suited for this is the scopes. Check out the scope documentation for more information about this approach.

# Validation

Almost every application needs to check that the input supplied by the user conforms to a set of rules or are otherwise acceptable. TornadoFX sports an extensible validation and decoration framework.

We will first look at validation as a standalone feature before we integrate it with the `ViewModel`.

## Under the Hood

The following explanation is a bit verbose and does not reflect the way you would write validation code in your application. This section will provide you with a solid understanding of how validation works and how the individual pieces fit together.

### Validator

A `Validator` knows how to inspect user input of a specified type and will return a `ValidationMessage` with a `ValidationSeverity` describing how the input compares to the expected input for a specific control. If a `Validator` deems that there is nothing to report for an input value, it returns `null`. A text message can optionally accompany the `ValidationMessage`, and would normally be displayed by the `Decorator` configured in the `ValidationContext`. We will cover more on decorates later.

The following severity levels are supported:

* `Error` - Input was not accepted
* `Warning` - Input is not ideal, but accepted
* `Success` - Input is accepted
* `Info` - Input is accepted

There are multiple severity levels representing successful input to easier provide the contextually correct feedback in most cases. For example, you might want to give an informational message for a field no matter the input value, or specifically mark fields with a green checkbox when they are entered. The only severity that will result in an invalid status is the `Error` level.

### ValidationTrigger

By default validation will happen when the input value changes. The input value is always an `ObservableValue<T>`, and the default trigger simply listens for changes. You can however choose  
to validate when the input field looses focus, or when a save button is clicked for instance. The following ValidationTriggers can be configured for each validator:

* `OnChange` - Validate when input value changes, optionally after a given delay in milliseconds
* `OnBlur` - Validate when the input field looses focus
* `Never` - Only validate when `ValidationContext.validate()` is called

### ValidationContext

Normally you would validate user input from multiple controls or input fields at once. You can gather these validators in a `ValidationContext` so you can check if all validators are valid, or ask the validation context to perform validation for all fields at any given time. The context also controls what kind of decorator will be used to convey the validation message for each field. See the Ad Hoc validation example below.

## Decorator

The `decorationProvider` of a `ValidationContext` is in charge of providing feedback when a `ValidationMessage` is associated with an input. By default this is an instance of `SimpleMessageDecorator`which will mark the input field with a colored triangle in the topper left corner and display a popup with the message while the input has focus.

If you don't like the default decorator look you can easily create your own by implementing the `Decorator` interface:

```kotlin
interface Decorator {
    fun decorate(node: Node)
    fun undecorate(node: Node)
}
```

You can assign your decorator to a given `ValidationContext` like this:

```kotlin
context.decorationProvider = MyDecorator()
```

**Tip: You can create a decorator that applies CSS style classes to your inputs instead of overlaying other nodes to provide feedback.**

## Ad Hoc Validation

While you will probably never do this in a real application, it is possible to set up a `ValidationContext` and apply validators to it manually. The following  
example is actually taken from the internal tests of the framework. It illustrates the concept, but is not a practical pattern in an application.

```kotlin
// Create a validation context
val context = ValidationContext()

// Create a TextField we can attach validation to
val input = TextField()

// Define a validator that accepts input longer than 5 chars
val validator = context.addValidator(input, input.textProperty()) {
    if (it!!.length < 5) error("Too short") else null
}

// Simulate user input
input.text = "abc"

// Validation should fail
assertFalse(validator.validate())

// Extract the validation result
val result = validator.result

// The severity should be error
assertTrue(result is ValidationMessage && result.severity == ValidationSeverity.Error)

// Confirm valid input passes validation
input.text = "longvalue"
assertTrue(validator.validate())
assertNull(validator.result)
```

Take special note of the last parameter to the `addValidator` call. This is the actual validation logic. The function is passed the  
current input for the property it validates and must return null if there are no messages, or an instance of `ValidationMessage` if something  
is noteworthy about the input. A message with severity `Error` will cause the validation to fail. As you can see, you don't need to instantiate  
a ValidationMessage yourself, simply use one of the functions `error`, `warning`, `success` or `info` instead.

# Validation with ViewModel

Every ViewModel contains a `ValidationContext`, so you don't need to instantiate one yourself. The Validation framework integrates with the type  
safe builders as well, and even provides some built in validators, like the `required` validator. Going back to our person editor, we can  
make the input fields required with this simple change:

```kotlin
field("Name") {
    textfield(model.name).required()
}
```

That's all there is to it. The required validator optionally takes a message that will be presented to the user if the validation fails. The default text  
is "This field is required".

Instead of using the built in `required` validator we can express the same thing manually:

```kotlin
field("Name") {
    textfield(model.name).validator {
        if (it.isNullOrBlank()) error("The name field is required") else null
    }
}
```

If you want to further customize the textfield, you might want to add another set of curly braces:

```kotlin
field("Name") {
    textfield(model.name) {
        // Manipulate the text field here
        validator {
            if (it.isNullOrBlank()) error("The name field is required") else null
        }
    }
}
```

## Binding buttons to validation state

You might want to only enable certain buttons in your forms when the input is valid. The `model.valid` property can be used for this purpose. Since  
the default validation trigger is `OnChange`, the valid state would only be accurate when you first try to commit the model. However, if you want  
to bind a button to the `valid` state of the model you can call `model.validate(decorateErrors = false)` to force all validators to report their results without  
actually showing any validation errors to the user.

```kotlin
field("username") {
    textfield(username).required()
}
field("password") {
    passwordfield(password).required()
}
buttonbar {
    button("Login", ButtonBar.ButtonData.OK_DONE).setOnAction {
        enableWhen { model.valid }
        model.commit {
            doLogin()
        }
    }
}
// Force validators to update the `model.valid` property
model.validate(decorateErrors = false)
```

Notice how the login button's enabled state is bound to the enabled state of the model via `enableWhen { model.valid }` call. After all  
the fields and validators are configured, the `model.validatE(decorateErrors = false)` make sure the valid state of the model is updated  
without triggering error decorations on the fields that fail validation. The decorators will kick in on value change by default, unless you  
override the `trigger` parameter to `validator`. The `required()` build in validator also accepts this parameter. For example, to run the validator  
only when the input field looses focus you can call `textfield(username).required(ValidationTrigger.OnBlur)`.

# Validation in dialogs

The `dialog` builder creates a window with a form and a fieldset and let's you start adding fields to it. Some times you don't have a ViewModel for such cases, but you might still want to  
use the features it provides. For such situations you can instantiate a ViewModel inline and hook up one or more properties to it. Here is an example dialog that requires the user to enter some input in a textarea:

```kotlin
dialog("Add note") {
    val model = ViewModel()
    val note = model.bind { SimpleStringProperty() }

    field("Note") {
        textarea(note) {
            required()
            whenDocked { requestFocus() }
        }
    }
    buttonbar {
        button("Save note") {
            setOnAction {
                model.commit { doSave() }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Notice how the `note` property is connected to the context by specifying it's bean parameter. This is crucial for making the field validation available.

# TableViewEditModel

If you are pressed for screen real estate and do not have space for a master/detail setup with a `TableView`, an effective option is to edit the `TableView` directly. By enabling a few streamlined features in TornadoFX, you can not only enable easy cell editing but also enable dirty state tracking, committing, and rollback. By calling `enableCellEditing()` and `enableDirtyTracking()`, as well as accessing the `tableViewEditModel` property of a `TableView`, you can easily enable this functionality.

When you edit a cell, a blue flag will indicate its dirty state. Calling `rollback()` will revert dirty cells to their original values, whereas `commit()` will set the current values as the new baseline \(and remove all dirty state history\).

```kotlin
import tornadofx.*

class MyApp: App(MyView::class)
class MyView : View("My View") {

    val controller: CustomerController by inject()
    var tableViewEditModel: TableViewEditModel<Customer> by singleAssign()

    override val root =  borderpane {
        top = buttonbar {
            button("COMMIT").setOnAction {
                tableViewEditModel.commit()
            }
            button("ROLLBACK").setOnAction {
                tableViewEditModel.rollback()
            }
        }
        center = tableview<Customer> {

            items = controller.customers
            isEditable = true

            column("ID",Customer::idProperty)
            column("FIRST NAME", Customer::firstNameProperty).makeEditable()
            column("LAST NAME", Customer::lastNameProperty).makeEditable()

            enableCellEditing() //enables easier cell navigation/editing
            enableDirtyTracking() //flags cells that are dirty

            tableViewEditModel = editModel
        }
    }
}

class CustomerController : Controller() {
    val customers = listOf(
            Customer(1, "Marley", "John"),
            Customer(2, "Schmidt", "Ally"),
            Customer(3, "Johnson", "Eric")
    ).observable()
}

class Customer(id: Int, lastName: String, firstName: String) {
    var lastName by property(lastName)
    fun lastNameProperty() = getProperty(Customer::lastName)
    var firstName by property(firstName)
    fun firstNameProperty() = getProperty(Customer::firstName)
    var id by property(id)
    fun idProperty() = getProperty(Customer::id)}
```

**Figure 11.4** A `TableView` with dirty state tracking, with `rollback()` and `commit()` functionality.

Note also there are many other helpful properties and functions on the `TableViewEditModel`. The `items` property is an `ObservableMap<S, TableColumnDirtyState<S>>` mapping the dirty state of each record item `S`. If you want to filter out and commit only dirty records so you can persist them somewhere, you can have your "Commit" `Button` perform this action instead.

```kotlin
button("COMMIT").setOnAction {
    tableViewEditModel.items.asSequence()
            .filter { it.value.isDirty }
            .forEach {
                println("Committing ${it.key}")
                it.value.commit()
            }
}
```

There are also `commitSelected()` and `rollbackSelected()` to only commit or rollback the selected records in the `TableView`.
