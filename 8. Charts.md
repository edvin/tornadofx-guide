# Charts

JavaFX comes with a [handy set of charts](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/charts/chart-overview.htm) to quickly display data visualizations. While there are more comprehensive charting libraries like [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) and [Orson Charts](http://www.object-refinery.com/orsoncharts/) which work fine with TornadoFX, the built-in JavaFX charts satisfy a majority of visualization needs. They also have elegant animations when data is populated or changed.

TornadoFX comes with a few builders to streamline the declaration of charts using functional constructs.


## PieChart

The `PieChart` is a common visual aid to illustrate proportions of a whole. It is structurally simpler than XY charts which we will learn about later. Inside a `piechart()` builder you can call the `data()` function to pass multiple category-value pairs (Figure 8.1).

```kotlin
piechart("Desktop/Laptop OS Market Share") {
    data("Windows", 77.62)
    data("OS X", 9.52)
    data("Other", 3.06)
    data("Linux", 1.55)
    data("Chrome OS", 0.55)
}
```

**Figure 8.1**

Note you can also provide an explicit `ObservableList<PieChart.Data>` prepared in advance.


```kotlin
val items = listOf(
        PieChart.Data("Windows", 77.62),
        PieChart.Data("OS X", 9.52),
        PieChart.Data("Other", 3.06),
        PieChart.Data("Linux", 1.55),
        PieChart.Data("Chrome OS", 0.55)
).observable()

piechart("Desktop/Laptop OS Market Share", items)
```

The block following `piechart` can be used to modify any of the attributes of the `PieChart` just like any other control builder we covered. You can also leverage `for()` loops, Sequences, and other iterative tools within a block to add any number of data items.

```kotlin
val items = listOf(
        PieChart.Data("Windows", 77.62),
        PieChart.Data("OS X", 9.52),
        PieChart.Data("Other", 3.06),
        PieChart.Data("Linux", 1.55),
        PieChart.Data("Chrome OS", 0.55)
).observable()

piechart("Desktop/Laptop OS Market Share") {
    for (item in items) {
        data.add(item)
    }
}
```

### Map-Based Data Sources

Sometimes you may want to build a chart using a `Map` as a datasource. Using the Kotlin `to` operator, you can construct a `Map` in a Kotlin-esque way and then pass it to the `data` function.

```kotlin
 val items = mapOf(
        "Windows" to 77.62,
        "OS X" to 9.52,
        "Other" to 3.06,
        "Linux" to 1.55,
        "Chrome OS" to 0.55
)

piechart("Desktop/Laptop OS Market Share") {
    data(items)
}
```

## XY Based Charts

Most charts often deal with one or more series of data points on an XY axis. The most common are bar and line charts.

### Bar Charts

You can represent one or more series of data points through a `BarChart`. This chart makes it easy to compare different data points relative to their distance from the X or Y axis (Figure 8.2).

```kotlin
 barchart("Unit Sales Q2 2016", CategoryAxis(), NumberAxis()) {
    series("Product X") {
        data("MAR", 10245)
        data("APR", 23963)
        data("MAY", 15038)
    }
    series("Product Y") {
        data("MAR", 28443)
        data("APR", 22845)
        data("MAY", 19045)
    }
}
```

**Figure 8.2**

Above, the `series()` and `data()` functions allow quick construction of data structures backing the charts. On construction, you will need to construct the proper `Axis` type for each X and Y axis. In this example, the months are not necessarily numeric but rather Strings. Therefore they are best represented by a `CategoryAxis`. The units, already being numeric, are fit to use a `NumberAxis`.

>In the `series()` and `data()` blocks, you can customize further properties like colors. You can even call `style()` to quickly apply type-safe CSS to the chart.


## LineChart and AreaChart

A `LineChart` connects data points on an XY axis with lines, quickly visualizing upward and downward trends between them (Figure 8.3)

```kotlin
linechart("Unit Sales Q2 2016", CategoryAxis(), NumberAxis()) {
    series("Product X") {
        data("MAR", 10245)
        data("APR", 23963)
        data("MAY", 15038)
    }
    series("Product Y") {
        data("MAR", 28443)
        data("APR", 22845)
        data("MAY", 19045)
    }
}
```

**Figure 8.3**

The backing data structure is not much different than a `BarChart`, and you use the `series()` and `data()` functions in the same manner.

You can also use a variant of `LineChart` called `AreaChart`, which will shade the area under the lines a distinct color, as well as any overlaps (Figure 8.4).

### Multiseries

You can streamline the declaration of more than one series using the `multiseries()` function, and call the `data()` functions with `varargs` values. We can consolidate our previous example using this construct:

```kotlin
linechart("Unit Sales Q2 2016", CategoryAxis(), NumberAxis()) {

    multiseries("Product X", "Product Y") {
        data("MAR", 10245, 28443)
        data("APR", 23963, 22845)
        data("MAY", 15038, 19045)
    }
}
```

This is just another convenience to reduce boilerplate and quickly declare your data structure for a chart.

### ScatterChart

A `ScatterChart` is the simplest representation of an XY data series. It plots the points without bars or lines. It is often used to plot a large volume of data points in order to find clusters. Here is a brief example of a `ScatterChart` plotting machine capacities by week for two different product lines (Figure 8.5).


```kotlin
scatterchart("Machine Capacity by Product/Week", NumberAxis(), NumberAxis()) {
    series("Product X") {
        data(1,24)
        data(2,22)
        data(3,23)
        data(4,19)
        data(5,18)
    }
    series("Product Y") {
        data(1,12)
        data(2,15)
        data(3,9)
        data(4,11)
        data(5,7)
    }
}
```

 **Figure 8.5**

### BubbleChart


`BubbleChart` is another XY chart similar to the `ScatterPlot`, but there is a third variable to control the radius of each point. You can leverage this to show, for instance, output by week with the bubble radii reflecting number of machines used (Figure 8.6).


```kotlin
 bubblechart("Machine Capacity by Output/Week", NumberAxis(), NumberAxis()) {
    series("Product X") {
        data(1,24,1)
        data(2,46,2)
        data(3,23,1)
        data(4,27,2)
        data(5,18,1)
    }
    series("Product Y") {
        data(1,12,1)
        data(2,31,2)
        data(3,9,1)
        data(4,11,1)
        data(5,15,2)
    }
}
```

## Summary

Charts are a an effective way to visualize data, and the builders in TornadoFX help create them quickly. You can read more about JavaFX charts in [Oracle's documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/user-interface-tutorial/charts.htm). If you need more advanced charting functionality, there are libraries like [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) and [Orson Charts](http://www.object-refinery.com/orsoncharts/) you can leverage and interop with TornadoFX, but this is beyond the scope of this book.
