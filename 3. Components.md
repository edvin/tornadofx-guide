# Components

JavaFX uses a theatrical analogy to organize an `Application` with `Stage` and `Scene` components.
TornadoFX builds on this by providing `View`, `Controller`, and `Fragment` components. While the `Stage`, and `Scene` are used by
TornadoFX, the `View`, `Controller`, and `Fragment` introduces new concepts that streamline development. Many of these components are automatically
maintained as singletons, and can communicate to each other through simple dependency injections and other means.

You also have the option to utilize FXML which will be discussed much later. But first, lets extend `App` to create an entry point that launches a
TornadoFX application.

##App and View Basics

To create a TornadoFX application, you must have at least one class that extends `App`. An **App** is the entry point to the application and specifies
the initial `View`. It does in fact extend JavaFX `Application`, but you do not necessarily need to specify a `start()` or `main()` method.

But first, extend `App` to create your own implementation and specify the primary view as the first constructor argument.

```kotlin
class MyApp: App(MyView::class)
```

A **View** contains display logic as well as a layout of Nodes, similar to the JavaFX `Stage`. It is automatically managed as a singleton. When you
declare a `View` you must specify a `root` property which can be any `Node` type, and that will hold the View's content.

In the same Kotlin file or in a new file, extend a class off of `View`. Override the abstract `root` property and assign it `VBox` or any other `Node`
you choose.

```kotlin
class MyView: View() {
    override val root = VBox()
}
```

However, we might want to populate this `VBox` acting as the `root` control. Using the
 [initializer block](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/classes.html#constructors), let's add a JavaFX `Button` and a `Label`.
  You can use the "plus assign" `+=` operators to add children to any `Pane` type, including this `VBox`.

```kotlin
class MyView: View() {
    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        root += Button("Press Me")
        root += Label("")
    }
}
```

While it is pretty clear what's going on from looking at this code, TornadoFX provides a builder syntax that will streamline your UI code further and
make it much easier to reason about the resulting UI just by looking at the code. We will gradually move into builder syntax, and finally
cover builders in full in the next chapter.

While we introduce you to new concepts you might some times see code that is not using best practices. We do this to introduce you to the concepts
and to give you a broader understanding of what's going on under the covers. Gradually we will introduce more powerful constructs to solve the
problem at hand in a better way.

Next we will see how to run this application.


## Starting a TornadoFX Application

Newer versions of the JVM know how to start JavaFX applications without a `main()` method. A JavaFX application, and by extension a TornadoFX application, is any class that extends `javafx.application.Application`. Since `tornadofx.App` extends `javafx.application.Application`, TornadoFX apps are no different. Therefore you would start the app by referencing `com.example.app.MyApp`, and you don't necessarily need a `main()` function unless you need to supply command line arguments. In that case you would add a package level main function to the `MyApp.kt` file:

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  Application.launch(MyApp::class.java, *args)
}
```

This main function would be compiled to `com.example.app.MyAppKt` - notice the `Kt` at the end. When you create a package
level main function, it will always have a class name of the fully qualified package, plus the file name, appended with `Kt`.

For launching and testing the `App`, we will use Intellij IDEA. Navigate to *Run*→*Edit Configurations* (Figure 3.1).

**Figure 3.1**

![](http://i.imgur.com/msTSPNm.png)

Click the green "+" sign and create a new Application configuration (Figure 3.2).

**Figure 3.2**
![](http://i.imgur.com/OeejuvB.png)

Specify the name of your "Main class" which should be your `App` class. You will also need to specify the module it resides in. Give the configuration a meaningful name such as "Launcher". After that click "OK" (Figure 3.3).

**Figure 3.3**

![](http://i.imgur.com/0QayTdJ.png)

You can run your TornadoFX application by selecting *Run*→*Run 'Launcher'* or whatever you named the configuration (Figure 3.4).

**Figure 3.4**

You should now see your application launch (Figure 3.5)

Congratulations! You have written your first (albeit simple) TornadoFX application. It may not look like much right now, but as we cover more of TornadoFX's powerful features we will be creating large, impressive user interfaces with little code in no time. But first let's understand a little better what is happening between `App` and `View`.

##Understanding Views

Let's dive a little deeper into how a `View` works and how it can be used. Take a look at the `App` and `View` classes we just built.

```kotlin
class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView: View() {
    override val root = VBox()

    init {
        with(root) {
            this += Button("Press Me")
            this += Label("Waiting")
        }
    }
}
```

A `View` contains a hierarchy of JavaFX Nodes and is injected by name wherever it is called. In the next section we will learn how to leverage powerful
builders to create these `Node` hierarchies quickly. There is only one instance of `MyView` maintained by TornadoFX, effectively making it a singleton.
TornadoFX also supports scopes, which can group together a collection of `View`s, `Fragment`s and `Controller`s in a separate namespace if you will, resulting
in a `View` only being a singleton inside that scope. This is great for [Multiple-Document Interface applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa263481.aspx)
and other advanced use cases. More on this later.

##Using inject() and Embedding Views

You can also inject one or more Views into another `View`. Below we embed a `TopView` and `BottomView` into a `MasterView`. Note we use the `inject()` delegate property to lazily inject the `TopView` and `BottomView` instances. Then we call each "child" View's `root` to assign them to the `BorderPane` (Figure 3.6).

```kotlin
class MasterView: View() {
    val topView: TopView by inject()
    val bottomView: BottomView by inject()

    override val root = borderpane {
        top = topView.root
        bottom = bottomView.root
    }
}

class TopView: View() {
    override val root = label("Top View")
}

class BottomView: View() {
    override val root = label("Bottom View")
}
```

**Figure 3.6**

![](http://i.imgur.com/3o7fFwe.png)

If you need Views to communicate to each other, you can create a property in each of the "child" Views that holds the "parent" `View`.

```kotlin
class MasterView : View() {
    override val root = BorderPane()

    val topView: TopView by inject()
    val bottomView: BottomView by inject()

    init {
        with(root) {
            top = topView.root
            bottom = bottomView.root
        }

        topView.parent = this
        bottomView.parent = this
    }
}

class TopView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Top View")
    lateinit var parent: MasterView
}

class BottomView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Bottom View")
    lateinit var parent: MasterView
}
```

More typically you would use a `Controller` or a `ViewModel` to communicate between views, and we will visit this topic later.

##Injection Using find()
The `inject()` delegate will lazily assign a given component to a property. The first time that component is called is when it will be retrieved. Alternatively, instead of using the `inject()` delegate you can use the `find()` function to retrieve a singleton instance of a `View` or other components.

```kotlin
class MasterView : View() {
    override val root = BorderPane()

    val topView = find(TopView::class)
    val bottomView = find(BottomView::class)

    init {
        with(root) {
            top = topView.root
            bottom = bottomView.root
        }
    }
}

class TopView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Top View")
}

class BottomView: View() {
    override val root = Label("Bottom View")
}
```
You can use either `find()` or `inject()`, but using `inject()` delegates is the preferred means to perform dependency injection.

While we will cover builders more in depth in the next chapter, it is time to reveal that the above example can be written in a much more concise
and expressive syntax:

```kotlin
class MasterView : View() {
    override val root = borderpane {
        top(TopView::class)
        bottom(BottomView::class)
    }
}
```

In stead of injecting the `TopView` and `BottomView` and then assigning their respective root nodes to the `BorderPane`s `top` and `bottom` property,
we specify the `BorderPane` with the builder syntax (all lower case) and then declaratively tell TornadoFX to pull in the two subviews and assign
them to the `top` and `bottom` properties automatically. We hope you'll agree that this is just as expressive, with a lot less boiler plate. This is
one of the most important principles TornadoFX tries to live by: Reduce boiler plate, increase readability. The end result is often less code and
less bugs.

##Controllers
In many cases, it is considered a good practice to separate a UI into three distinct parts:

1. **Model** - The business code layer that holds core logic and data
2.  **View** - The visual display with various input and output controls
3.  **Controller** - The "middleman" mediating events between the Model and the View

> There are other flavors of MVC like MVVM and MVP, all of which can be leveraged in TornadoFX.

While you could put all logic from the Model and Controller right into the view, it is often cleaner to separate these three pieces distinctly to maximize reusability.
One commonly used pattern to accomplish this is the MVC pattern. In TornadoFX, a `Controller` can be injected to support a `View`.

Here is a simple example. Create a simple `View` with a `TextField` whose value is written to a "database" when a `Button` is clicked.
We can inject a `Controller` that handles interacting with the model that writes to the database. Since this example is simplified, there will be no database but a printed message will serve as a placeholder (Figure 3.7).


```kotlin
class MyView : View() {
    val controller: MyController by inject()
    var inputField: TextField by singleAssign()

    override val root = vbox {
        label("Input")
        inputField = textfield()
        button("Commit") {
            setOnAction {
                controller.writeToDb(inputField.text)
                inputField.clear()
            }
        }
    }
}


class MyController: Controller() {
    fun writeToDb(inputValue: String) {
        println("Writing $inputValue to database!")
    }
}
```

**Figure 3.7**

![](http://i.imgur.com/CKG7Fb9.png)

When we build the UI, we make sure to add a reference to the inputField so that it can be references from the onClick
event handler of the "Commit" button later. When the "Commit" button is clicked, you will see the Controller prints a
line to the console.

```
Writing Alpha to database!
```

It is important to note that while the above works, and may even look pretty good, it is a good practice to avoid
referencing other UI elements directly. Your code will be much easier to refactor if you bind your UI elements to
properties and manipulate the properties instead. We will introduce the `ViewModel` later, which provides even easier
ways to deal with this type of interaction.

### Long running tasks

Whenever you call a function in a controller you need to determine if that function returns immediately or if it
performs potentially long running tasks. If you call a function on the JavaFX Application Thread, the UI
will be unresponsive until the call completes. Unresponsive UI's is a killer for user perception, so make
sure that you run expensive operations in the background. TornadoFX provides the `runAsync` function to help with this.

Code placed inside a `runAsync` block will run in the background. If the result of the background call should update your UI, you must
make sure that you apply the changes on the JavaFX Application Thread. The `ui` block does exactly that.

```kotlin
val textfield = textfield()
button("Update text") {
    setOnAction {
        runAsync {
            myController.loadText()
        } ui { loadedText ->
            textfield.text = loadedText
        }
    }
}
```

When the button is clicked, the action inside the `action` builder (which delegates the `ActionEvent` to `setAction` method) is run.
It makes a call out to `myController.loadText()`and applies the result to the text property of the textfield when it returns.
The UI stays responsive while the controller function runs.

Under the covers, `runAsync` creates a JavaFX `Task` objects, and spins off a separate thread to run your call inside the `Task`.
You can assign this `Task` to a variable and bind it to a UI to show progress while your operation is running.

In fact, this is so common that there is also an default ViewModel called `TaskStatus` which contains observable values
 for `running`, `message`, `title`, and `progress`. You can supply the `runAsync` call with a specific instance of the
  `TaskStatus` object, or use the default.

The TornadoFX sources includes an example usage of this in the `AsyncProgressApp.kt` file.

There is also a version of `runAsync` called `runAsyncWithProgress` which will cover the current node with a progress indicator while the
long running operation runs.

###singleAssign() Property Delegate

In the example above we initialized the `inputField` property with the `singleAssign` delegate. If you want to guarantee that a value is only assigned once, you can use the `singleAssign()` delegate instead of the `lateinit` keyword from Kotlin.
This will cause a second assignment to throw an error, and it will also error when it is prematurely accessed before it is assigned.

You can look up more about `singleAssign()` in detail in Appendix A1, but know for now it guarantees a `var` can only be assigned once. It is also threadsafe and helps mitigate issues with mutability.

You can also use Controllers to provide data to a `View` (Figure 3.8).

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {
    val controller: MyController by inject()

    override val root = vbox {
        label("My items")
        listview(controller.values)
    }
}

class MyController: Controller() {
    val values = FXCollections.observableArrayList("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta")
}
```
**Figure 3.8**

![](http://i.imgur.com/oKL9ZVD.png)

The `VBox` contains a `Label` and a `ListView`, and the `items` property of the `ListView` is assigned to the `values` property of our `Controller`.

Whether they are reading or writing data, Controllers can have long-running tasks and should not perform work on the JavaFX thread. You will learn how to easily offload work to a worker thread using the `runAsync` construct later in this chapter.

##Fragment

Any `View` you create is a singleton, which means you typically use it in only one place at a time. The reason for this is that the root node of the `View`
can only have a single parent in a JavaFX application. If you assign it another parent, it will disappear from it's prior parent.

However, if you would like to create a piece of UI that is short-lived or can be used in multiple places, consider using
a `Fragment`. A **Fragment** is a special type of `View` that can have multiple instances. They are particularly useful for popups or
as pieces of a larger UI, or even just a single ListCell. We will look at a specialized fragment called `ListCellFragment` later.

Both `View` and `Fragment` support `openModal()`, `openWindow` and `openInternalWindow` that
will open the root node in a separate Window.

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {
    override val root = vbox {
        button("Press Me") {
            setOnAction {
                find(MyFragment::class).openModal(stageStyle = StageStyle.UTILITY)
            }
        }
    }
}

class MyFragment: Fragment() {
    override val root = label("This is a popup")
}
```

You can pass optional arguments to `openModal()` as well to modify a few of its behaviors.

**Optional Arguments for openModal()**

|Argument|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|stageStyle|StageStyle|Defines one of the possible enum styles for `Stage`. Default: `StageStyle.DECORATED`|
|modality|Modality|Defines one of the possible enum modality types for `Stage`. Default: `Modality.APPLICATION_MODAL`|
|escapeClosesWindow|Boolean|Sets the `ESC` key to call `closeModal()`. Default: `true`|
|owner|Window|Specify the owner Window for this Stage`|
|block|Boolean|Block UI execution until the Window closes. Default: `false`|

## InternalWindow

While `openModal` opens in a new `Stage`, `openInternalWindow` opens over the current root node, or any other node if you specify it:

```kotlin
    button("Open editor") {
        setOnAction {
            openInternalWindow(Editor::class)
        }
    }
```

**Figure 3.9**

![](http://i.imgur.com/7Z0X5QL.png)

A good use case for the internal window is for single stage environments like JPro, or if you want to customize the window trim to make
the window appear more in line with the design of your application. The Internal Window can be styled with CSS. Take a look at the `InternalWindow.Styles`
class for more information about styleable properties.

The internal window API differs from modal/window in one important aspect. Since the window opens over an existing node, you typically
call `openInternalWindow()` from within the View you want it to open on top of. You supply the View you want to show, and you can optionally
supply what node to open over via the `owner` parameter.

**Optional Arguments for openInternalWindow()**

|Argument|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|view|UIComponent|The component will be the content of the new window|
|view|KClass<UIComponent>|Alternatively, you can supply the class of the view instead of an instance|
|icon|Node|Optional window icon|
|scope|Scope|If you specify the view class, you can also specify the scope used to fetch the view|
|modal|Boolean|Defines if the covering node should be disabled while the internal window is active. Default: `true`|
|escapeClosesWindow|Boolean|Sets the `ESC` key to call `close()`. Default: `true`|
|owner|Node|Specify the owner Node for this window. The window will by default cover the root node of this view.`|

## Closing modal windows

Any `Component` opened using `openModal()`, `openWindow()` or `openInternalWindow()` can be closed by calling `closeModal()`. It's also possible to get to the `InternalWindow` instance directly if needed using `findParentOfType(InternalWindow::class)`.

## Replacing Views and Docking Events

With TornadoFX, is easy to swap your current `View` with another `View` using `replaceWith()`, and optionally add a transition. In the example below, a `Button` on each `View` will switch to the other view, which can be `MyView1` or `MyView2` (Figure 3.10).

```kotlin

class MyView1: View() {
    override val root = vbox {
        button("Go to MyView2") {
            setOnAction {
                replaceWith(MyView2::class)
            }
        }
    }
}

class MyView2: View() {
    override val root = vbox {
        button("Go to MyView1") {
            setOnAction {
                replaceWith(MyView1::class)
            }
        }
    }
}

```

**Figure 3.10**

![](http://i.imgur.com/IkInGZh.png)


You also have the option to specify a spiffy animation for the transition between the two Views.

```kotlin
replaceWith(MyView1::class, ViewTransition.Slide(0.3.seconds, Direction.LEFT)
```

This works by replacing the `root` `Node` on given `View` with another `View`'s `root`. There are two functions you can override on `View` to leverage when a View's `root` `Node` is connected to a parent (`onDock()`), and when it is disconnected (`onUndock()`). You can leverage these two events to connect and "clean up" whenever a `View` comes in or falls out. You will notice running the code below that whenever a `View` is swapped, it will undock that previous `View` and dock the new one. You can leverage these two events to manage initialization and disposal tasks.

```kotlin
class MyView1: View() {
    override val root = vbox {
        button("Go to MyView2") {
            setOnAction {
                replaceWith(MyView2::class)
            }
        }
    }

    override fun onDock() {
        println("Docking MyView1!")
    }

    override fun onUndock() {
        println("Undocking MyView1!")
    }
}

class MyView2: View() {
    override val root = vbox {
        button("Go to MyView1") {
            setOnAction {
                replaceWith(MyView1::class)
            }
        }
    }

    override fun onDock() {
        println("Docking MyView2!")
    }
    override fun onUndock() {
        println("Undocking MyView2!")
    }
}
```

## Passing parameters to views

The best way to pass information between views is often an injected ViewModel. Even so, it can still be convenient to be able to pass parameters to other components. The `find` and `inject` functions supports varargs of `Pair<String, Any>` which can be used for just this purpose. Consider a customer list that opens a customer editor for the selected customer. The action to edit a customer might look like this:

```kotlin
fun editCustomer(customer: Customer) {
    find<CustomerEditor>(mapOf(CustomerEditor::customer to customer).openWindow())
}
```

The parameters are passed as a map, where the key is the property in the view and the value is whatever you want the property to be.
This gives you a type safe way of configuring parameters for the target View.

Here we use the Kotlin `to` syntax to create the parameter. This could also have been written as `Pair(CustomerEditor::customer, customer)` if you prefer. The editor can now access the parameter like this:

```kotlin
class CustomerEditor : Fragment() {
    val customer: Customer by param()

}
```

If you want to inspect the parameters instead of blindly relying on them to be available, you can either declare them as nullable or consult the `params` map:

```kotlin
class CustomerEditor : Fragment() {
    init {
        val customer = params["customer"] as? Customer
        if (customer != null) {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

If you don't care about type safety you can also pass parameters as `mapOf("customer" to customer)`, but then you miss out on automatic refactoring
if you rename a property in the target view.

## Accessing the primary stage

`View` has a property called `primaryStage` that allows you to manipulate properties of the `Stage` backing it, such as window size for example. Any `View` or `Fragment`
that were opened via `openModal` will also have a `modalStage` property available.

## Accessing the scene
Some times it is necessary to get a hold of the current scene from within a `View` or `Fragment`.
This can be achieved with `root.scene`, or if you are within a type safe builder, there is an even shorter way, just use `scene`.


## Accessing resources

Lot's of JavaFX APIs takes resources as an `URL` or the `toExternalForm` of an URL. To retrieve a resource url one would typically write something like:

```kotlin
val myAudioClip = AudioClip(MyView::class.java.getResource("mysound.wav").toExternalForm())
```

Every `Component` has a `resources` object which can retrieve the external form url of a resource like this:

```kotlin
val myAudiClip = AudioClip(resources["mysound.wav"])
```

If you need an actual `URL` it can be retrieved like this:

```kotlin
val myResourceURL = resources.url("mysound.wav")
```

The `resources` helper also has several other helpful functions to help you turn files relative to the `Component` into an object of the type you need:

```kotlin
val myJsonObject = resources.json("myobject.json")
val myJsonArray = resources.jsonArray("myarray.json")
val myStream = resources.stream("somefile")
```

It's worth mentioning that the `json` and `jsonArray` functions are also available on `InputStream` objects.

Resources are relative to the `Component` but you can also retrieve a resource by it's full path, starting with a `/`.

## Shortcuts and key combinations for actions

You can fire actions when certain key combinations are typed. This is done with the `shortcut` function:

```kotlin
shortcut(KeyCombination.valueOf("Ctrl+Y")) {
    doSomething()
}
```

There is also a string version of the `shortcut` function that does the same but is less verbose:

```kotlin
shortcut("Ctrl+Y")) {
    doSomething()
}
```

You can also add shortcuts to button actions directly:

```kotlin
button("Save") {
    setOnAction { doSave() }
    shortcut("Ctrl+S")
}
```

### Touch Support

JavaFX supports touch out of the box, and for now the only place we needed to improve it was to handle shortpress and longpress in a more convenient way. It consists of two functions similar to `action`, which
can be configured on any `Node`:

```kotlin
shortpress { println("Activated on short press") }
longpress { println("Activated on long press") }
```

Both functions accepts a `consume` parameter which by default is `false`. Setting it to true will prevent event bubbling for the press event. The `longpress` function additionally supports a `threshold` parameter which is used to
determine when a longpress has accured. It is `700.millis` by default.

## Summary

TornadoFX is filled with simple, streamlined, and powerful injection tools to manage Views and Controllers. It also streamlines dialogs and other small UI pieces using `Fragment`. While the applications we built so far are pretty simple, hopefully you appreciate the simplified concepts TornadoFX introduces to JavaFX. In the next chapter we will cover what is arguably the most powerful feature of TornadoFX: Type-Safe Builders.
